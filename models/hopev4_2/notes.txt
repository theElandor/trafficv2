Same as hopev4, the config file is below.
Now each vehicle in the random pool is initialized
with new parameters (beta and speed) each time
he reroutes, so there is actual variability.
If the performance is really bad, we might consider
to reroute once each 5k iterations, to reduce the
amount of randomness in traffic.
