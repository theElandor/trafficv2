this model will be trained the same way as hopev3 but
with RS = 20. So there's much less variability in the pool
of simulated vehicles.

Gains are really good, times are slightly higher for the
bidder with respect to the random bidder. In 140 vehicles
bot the times and the gains are really good for the random bidder.
