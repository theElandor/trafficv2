so now each stable vehicle has fixed beta and speed among all the simualations.
There is also a pool of random vehicles (40% of total) that are initialzied
with a random behaviour, so with random speed and beta
This is needed to add noise in the training phase.

--> need to redo experiments with standard behaviour.
