so now each stable vehicle has fixed beta and speed among all the simualations.
There is also a pool of random vehicles (40% of total) that are initialzied
with a random behaviour, so with random speed and beta
This is needed to add noise in the training phase.

--> need to redo experiments with standard behaviour.
----------------- POST EXPERIMENTS --------------
there is to much variability, the model is to simple to handle that.
Still need to figure out how the gains go from 70% down to 20% even for the small
variability. Will probably train another model with less variability on the speed
to check if that is the problem.
