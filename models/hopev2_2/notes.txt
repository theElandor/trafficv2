This model will be trained the same as
hopev2 but without the random speed factor, meaning
that the speed of the vehicles will all be assigned
following a function of the index (like in hopev3 and hopev4)
The variable pool is 0%, recreating the same setting
as hopev2 but with variable speed but not random speed.
-----------AFTER TEST-------------
the simulations with the bidder are the identical because
there is 0 variance, all of the vehicles around the test
vehicle behave exactly the same.
